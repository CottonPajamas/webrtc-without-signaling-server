try to get webrtc peer to peer connection without server.

still using turn or stun server.
seems to be no way to avoid that on the internet.
maybe possible to avoid on local network.

inspired by https://github.com/xem/miniWebRTC

which in turn was inspired by https://github.com/cjb/serverless-webrtc
